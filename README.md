Tools to make plotting easier in Python

`gunpowder' is a set of Python scripts to read
data from files and plot it in a variety of ways.

Examples include reading CSV files (or similar)
and converting the contents into lists of (lists of)
numbers, and using the ROOT data analysis framework
(http://root.cern.ch/) to produce histograms or graphs.

Support for gnuplot may be added later.
